## Laundry
This Django application allows users to view and reserve washing machines. It features a 14-day calendar where users can see machine availability by hour. Users can register, log in, and make reservations for specific machines and times. The system tracks reservations and allows users to cancel them if needed. Only logged-in users can make reservations or delete their bookings. The application ensures that users can only manage their own reservations or those of an admin. The Django application was hosted on Azure, but it is no longer active there.
